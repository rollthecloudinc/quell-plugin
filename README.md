Quell Plugin Starter Kit

Quell plugins are completely independent Angular applications that can be included at runtime into any Quell based application. Any plugin can be added without modifying Quell core and/or host application that the plugin will be used. This enables development of plugins that extend Quell independent of the core platform itself. Plugin authors deploy plugins on CDNs to publish publically. Once published any Quell publisher can add plugins at runtime in the browser when building pages without changing any code.
